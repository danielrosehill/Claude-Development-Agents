Please audit the API to ensure conformity with the Open API standard. Divide this task into the following steps:

1. Verify that the API contains a proper definition and that there are no partially implemented backend functions.
2. After validating this, check if the API is Open API standard compatible.
3. Finally, programmatically generate an Open API JSON definition.

If the server has an MCP, ensure that the Open API compatible JCI's existence is provided to the agent within the MCP configuration.
