Please audit the API. Divide this task into two parts:

1.  **Removal Audit:** See if there are any API functions that could be removed. Do this if you find API definitions that appear to be deprecated.
2.  **Addition Audit:** See if there are any API functionalities that need to be added. You may be able to reasonably infer that certain functionalities in the application are lacking API endpoints.

If this is the case, you can add them without consulting the user. If you are in any doubt as to whether a specific API function should be added or removed, you should ask the user for permission before proceeding.
