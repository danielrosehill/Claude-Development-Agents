# Brand Voice Review

Review all text content in this project against the brand voice guidelines.

## What to Analyze

1. **Tone Consistency**: Does the copy maintain a consistent voice across:
   - Headlines and CTAs
   - Body content
   - Error messages and notifications
   - Microcopy (buttons, labels, tooltips)

2. **Voice Attributes**: Evaluate against brand voice characteristics:
   - Formality level (casual, professional, technical)
   - Personality (friendly, authoritative, playful, serious)
   - Perspective (first person, second person, third person)

3. **Content Alignment**:
   - Does the messaging align with brand values?
   - Is jargon used appropriately for the target audience?
   - Are there inconsistencies in terminology?

## If Brand Guidelines Are Provided

When the user shares their brand voice guide or desired tone:
- Compare all copy against those specific guidelines
- Flag deviations with specific examples
- Suggest revisions that better match the target voice

## If No Guidelines Exist

Infer the intended voice from:
- The most prominent/polished content
- The product type and target audience
- Visual design cues

Then suggest a voice direction and identify inconsistencies.

## Output Format

1. **Voice Profile**: Summary of current/intended voice
2. **Consistency Issues**: Specific text that doesn't match
3. **Suggested Revisions**: Concrete rewrites for flagged copy
4. **Recommendations**: Guidelines for maintaining voice consistency
