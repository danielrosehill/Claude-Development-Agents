# Fresh Eyes - Stack Review

Take a step back and look at this project's technology stack with fresh eyes.

Consider whether the current choices still make sense, or if better alternatives have emerged:

1. **Framework Fit**: Is the current framework well-suited to what this application has become? Sometimes projects evolve beyond their original scope.

2. **Runtime & Language**: Given the project's actual requirements (performance, team familiarity, ecosystem needs), is the language/runtime choice optimal?

3. **Build & Bundling**: Are we using modern, efficient build tools? Could we simplify the build pipeline?

4. **Dependencies Balance**: Are we over-reliant on heavy dependencies for simple tasks, or under-utilizing powerful ones we already have?

5. **Infrastructure Alignment**: Does the hosting/deployment approach match the application's actual needs?

Don't just validate current choices - genuinely consider if starting fresh today, you'd make the same decisions. Provide honest recommendations, even if they suggest significant changes.
