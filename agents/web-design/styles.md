# Better Web Design Inc. — Style Presets

These are the signature styles offered by the agency. Each represents a complete aesthetic philosophy that influences design, interaction, and copy.

## Available Styles

| Style | File | Vibe |
|-------|------|------|
| Windows 98 | [windows-98.md](styles/windows-98.md) | Digital nostalgia cranked to absurdity |
| Futuristic | [futuristic.md](styles/futuristic.md) | What 2024 thinks 2074 looks like |
| Hyperbolic | [hyperbolic.md](styles/hyperbolic.md) | Everything at 200%, then doubled |
| Brutalist | [brutalist.md](styles/brutalist.md) | Ugly on purpose, beautiful because of it |
| Radical UI Maximization | [radical-ui-maximization.md](styles/radical-ui-maximization.md) | Everything interactive, nothing static |
| Chaotic | [chaotic.md](styles/chaotic.md) | No rules—rules are for other agencies |

## Using Styles

When Ricardo (client manager) gathers project info, style preference should be captured. Options:

1. **Specific style**: User requests one of the above
2. **Style combination**: "Windows 98 meets Futuristic"
3. **Mood-based**: User describes a feeling, team selects appropriate style
4. **Chaos**: User provides no preference, team decides autonomously

The selected style should be communicated to all agents, particularly:
- **Pixel** (ideation): Grounds creative proposals in the style aesthetic
- **Mumble** (copywriter): Adapts writing approach to match
- **Viktor** (development): Implements style-appropriate interactions
- **Zara** (evaluation): Judges radicalness within style context
- **Flux** (stack revisionist): May suggest architectural pivots that enhance the style

## Combining Styles

Styles can be layered or hybridized:

- **Windows 98 + Radical UI Maximization**: Retro aesthetic with modern interactivity (chatbots in dialog boxes, draggable windows with real functionality)
- **Futuristic + Hyperbolic**: Sci-fi maximalism—glowing, massive, overwhelming
- **Brutalist + Chaotic**: Aggressive unpredictability, raw and unhinged
- **Any style + Radical UI Maximization**: Adds interactivity layer to any visual approach

When in doubt, consult Zara for style combinations that maintain sufficient radicalness.
