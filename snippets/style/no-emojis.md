# No Emojis

Do not use emojis in any documentation, code comments, or file outputs. Emojis make technical documentation appear amateurish and unprofessional. Use plain text exclusively.

This applies to:
- Markdown documentation
- Code comments
- Commit messages
- README files
- Any generated text output

Replace any emotional indicators with plain descriptive text:
- Instead of "Warning" use "Warning:"
- Instead of "Complete" use "Complete" or "Done"
- Instead of "Deploy" use "Deploy" or "Release"
