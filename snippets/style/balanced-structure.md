# Balanced Document Structure

Balance document structure with content development. Avoid excessive use of subheadings, bullet points, and tables that fragment the flow of ideas.

## Heading Constraints

Each subheading should be followed by substantial prose (at least three developed sentences) before introducing the next subheading. Do not introduce a concept, immediately summarize it in a bullet point, and then jump to the next topic.

Limit heading nesting to three levels (H1, H2, H3) unless the document exceeds 3,000 words.

## Tables

Use tables only for:
- Comparative data
- Summary statistics
- Structured mappings that cannot be effectively conveyed through prose

Do not create tables that simply re-summarize content already covered in the text.

## Lists

Use bulleted lists for:
- Procedures and steps
- Distinct, enumerable items

Do not use lists as a substitute for paragraph development. If the points are conceptually intertwined, write them as a paragraph instead.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Topic churn: jumping between headings without developing ideas
- Fragmentation: breaking every sentence into a bullet point
- Redundant tables: summarizing what was just written in prose
- Excessive nesting: H4+ headings in short documents
