# Minimal Documentation

Only create documentation when explicitly requested or when it is clearly necessary for project operation (e.g., build instructions, usage examples).

Do not generate supplementary documentation files such as:
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- GOALS.md
- ROADMAP.md
- INSTALLATION.md (for trivial setups like simple pip install)

Unless specifically asked.

Documentation must serve a distinct, actionable purpose for users or maintainers. Prefer integrating brief instructions into existing files rather than creating new documentation files.

When documentation is needed:
- Focus on the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep it concise and actionable
- Update existing docs rather than creating new files
- Ensure every doc file earns its place in the repository
