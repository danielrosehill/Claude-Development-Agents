# Find the Root Cause

We're treating symptoms, not the disease. Before implementing any fix:

1. Ask "why" five times to trace back to the fundamental issue
2. Identify whether this is a one-off bug or a pattern indicating deeper problems
3. Consider if the architecture or design itself is flawed

Fixing the root cause prevents future occurrences. Patching symptoms creates technical debt.
