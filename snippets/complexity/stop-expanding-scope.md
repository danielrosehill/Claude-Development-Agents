# Stop Expanding Scope

Focus on the specific task at hand. Do not:

- Add features that weren't requested
- Refactor unrelated code
- Create abstractions for hypothetical future needs
- Add documentation beyond what's necessary
- Suggest improvements outside the current scope

Complete the requested task with minimal changes, then stop.
