# Wrong Direction

This approach isn't working. Rather than continuing to iterate on a failing strategy:

1. Acknowledge the approach isn't viable
2. Identify what we learned from the attempt
3. Propose a completely different direction

Don't be afraid to abandon sunk cost. A pivot now saves more time than persisting.
