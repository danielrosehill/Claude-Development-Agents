# We Went in Circles

The previous conversation got stuck in an unproductive loop. We kept trying variations of the same approach without making real progress.

Stop. Take a step back. Before proposing another solution:

1. What is the actual core problem we're solving?
2. Are we solving the right problem, or a symptom?
3. Is there a fundamentally simpler approach we dismissed too early?

Don't continue down the same path with minor tweaks.
